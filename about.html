						<strong>Oladimeji Mudele</strong> is a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
						Public Health
						mentored by Christopher Golden and Francesca Dominici. His work centers on the application of
						geospatial information and data science methods for connecting climate and health
						outcomes/policy. He holds an M.Sc in Electronic Engineering (summa cum laude) and a Ph.D. in
						Electronic, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (2021) from the University of Pavia
						(UNIPV), Italy. Before that, he had obtained a B.Eng (Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics
						Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria. During his Ph.D., he was
						a beneficiary of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions and the German Academic Exchange Service
						scholarships. Between 2018 and 2019, he was a visiting scholar at the Argentinean Commission for
						Space Activities and the Institute of Computing of the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil. In
						2019, he received the “Premio di Laurea” award as the top international scholar in UNIPV.

					<h2>WHAT I BELIEVE</h2>
					<p>
						Imagine walking into a place where I ask you to identify the judges of an event. It seems like a
						straightforward task, right? I could make it even easier by telling you that Mr A. is one of the
						judges. Now, could you tell me who the other judges are? Most likely, yes. The key here lies in
						the concepts of proximity and similarity, simple yet powerful ideas. People close to each other,
						dressing similarly, often have a connection, like being judges at an event.

						Let me illustrate this with an example from 1854 in London's Broad Street. There was a cholera
						outbreak, and initially, people didn't understand the cause. However, when they mapped the
						disease's occurrences, they discovered that those infected lived close to specific water pumps.
						Proximity to these pumps played a role in the spread of the disease. Again, it's about proximity
						and similarity, but the crucial part is gaining a new perspective.

						Perspective matters. Looking at our environment from new angles allows us to interpret and solve
						problems in innovative ways. That's what I do. I don't work with traditional maps; instead, I
						utilize satellite images. Satellites provide a unique perspective, allowing us to understand our
						environment better and, in turn, improve our lives.

						Recently, I developed an algorithm using high-resolution satellite images to map the extent and
						types of vegetation in urban areas globally. Why is this important? Research shows that people
						living in green environments are happier and healthier. My algorithm analyzes space-time
						composite satellite images, mathematically computing the proximity and similarity of the data.
						The result is a map detailing the types and extent of vegetation, valuable information for
						government and private sector initiatives aiming to enhance the quality of life worldwide. This
						is the power of a new perspective.
